# react-blog-axios

This is a silly little proof-of-concept app to play around with axios, react, and react router. It uses `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com` to as a dummy endpoint.

Steps to launch:

1. Install Node v10
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
